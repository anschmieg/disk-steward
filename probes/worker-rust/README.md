# Rust subprocess supervision probe

This development-only probe provides a small Rust counterpart to the Python
worker fixture. Running the binary with no arguments is a dry run: it starts
no child. `--run` starts two sequential copies of its own executable using
fixed internal modes. The flood child signals readiness and writes a finite
1 MiB synthetic stream; the stall child signals readiness and sleeps. The
parent reads stdout on a dedicated thread, retains no output bytes, stops
reading after 64 KiB plus one byte, and applies a one-second monotonic deadline.
On either limit it kills the child, waits for its exit, and joins the reader
before reporting success.

The executable path comes only from `current_exe()`. Parent arguments are
limited to none or `--run`; the private child dispatcher accepts only the two
fixed modes. There are no filesystem, network, credential, shell, or renderer
operations, and these children create no descendants.

This demonstrates bounded stdout reading and ordinary local child
kill/reap/thread-join behavior. It does not demonstrate Git ingress or store
budgets, production worker isolation, process-tree containment, CPU or memory
limits, or a hard guarantee if the operating system stalls `kill`, `wait`, or
thread joining. The stdout cap is not a network byte budget. No production
cleanup or user data is involved.

Run from the repository root:

```sh
cargo run -p disk-steward-worker-probe
cargo run -p disk-steward-worker-probe -- --run
cargo test -p disk-steward-worker-probe --locked
```

The live probe prints one result per case. The expected flood result is
`stop=OutputLimit bytes=65537`; the expected stall result is
`stop=Deadline bytes=1`. Each result requires a recorded child exit and
`reader_joined=true`. A missing readiness signal, reader failure or unconfirmed
cleanup returns an error instead. Elapsed time includes shutdown and may exceed
the one-second detection deadline; it is not an OS scheduling guarantee.
